    "#Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will use a clustering algorithm to analyze our data (i.e. YouTube comments of a single video).\n",
    "This will help us extract topics of discussion.\n",
    "We use the embeddings generated in Assignment 4 as input. \n",
    "(This notebook will not run without first running the assignment 4 Notebook, as it relies on the data in the folder 'output/')\n",
    "Each of our comments has been assigned a vector that encodes information about its meaning.\n",
    "The closer two vectors are, the more similar the meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each vector is of 512 Dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can cluster our data we need to reduce the embeddings' dimensionality to overcome the curse of dimensionality.\n",
    "We use the UMAP ALgorithm for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "After that we use the KMedoids Algorithm to partition the embedding space and generate our clusters this way.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to define the number of clusters we want to have. \n",
    "To find the optimal number of clusters, we use a simple optimization scheme.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the clusters are created, we visualize them.\n",
    "To do this we reduce the dimensionality of the embeddings again to two dimensions.\n",
    "Then we render a scatterplot of our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore we want to analyze and interpret our clusters.\n",
    "To do this, we:\n",
    "- print some statistics about each of the clusters\n",
    "- print cluster's medoid (the central sample)\n",
    "- print the cluster(s) we want to analyze further"

       "      <td>@dkosmari Im not sure what you mean by \"predicting temperatures\". There are predictions about temperature change. Like do you mean short term, or long term predictions? there are many accurate long-term predictions and forecasts about temperature and climate. If you are referring to short-term, one-day temperature predictions, then no, we cannot predict that. But thats the WEATHER, not the overall CLIMATE. I think you may be confusing the two. Another thing you mentioned was \"effective course of action\". There IS an effective course of action; reduce CO2 and greenhouse gas emissions. That would help preserve the stability of our climates. This is the course of action that would stop man's influence on climate change, but it would have terrible effects on the economy and progress. For this reason I agree with you 100% that innovation and technology is our best bet. And no. Im not saying that there was more man made climate change back then. What im saying is that climate change ALSO existed back then. Ever since the Industrial revolution, the climate has been increasingly volatile and unpredictable. But now, instead of a heatwave once every 10, or 15 years; there is a heatwave every 2 - 3 years. Heres another question for you. How do you explain all of the floodings and cat 5 hurricanes that have been happening? It seems like every couple years we have a \"Once in 100 year\" flood. To say that humans havent had an influence on this is ignorant. We cannot say forsure that climate change is due solely to human intervention, but there is a positive correlation between emissions and the increase in average global temperature. Finally, very few politicians are calling for those prescriptions. The ones that are suggesting these things, or \"Green New Deals\", are just imbeciles. But we should without a doubt consider some of these things - in a non-extreme proportion.</td>\n",

What that has to do with socialism and \"globalism\" I might never know. Also, our models have been accurate, they've successfully reproduced temperatures since 1900 globally, on land, in the air, and in the ocean. But the hyperbole and extreme rhetoric has been unwavering, which is a distraction from the actual dangers of global warming (which has nothing to do with Florida being underwater in three years, whoever made that up).   \n",

Just because car companies are investing in electric cars does not mean that actual fossil fuel companies (those that sell fossil fuels) are not against the idea that man made climate change is real.   \n",

There use to be snow in september. Now, we sometimes have no snow until january, no joke. I dont know if its human caused, but the average temperatire is rising, there's no way I could deny that.   \n",
       "181  There is a problem with the doctor/cancer analogy that was used. He mentions that the doctors would have no reason to lie to him. This is not the case, however, with Climate scientists. There funding i.e. income, is predicated on the notion that scientists agree that climate change is happening, that it is catastrophic and that it is human-caused. Note that the foremost hurricane forecaster, Bill Gray, received government funding for his research from 1960 to 1993. It was cut off by the Clinton Admistration since it went against the narrative of global warming and the catastrophic predictions of internet inventor Al Gore. There are plenty of scientists that disagree with man-made global warming including Nobel laureates. There are also scientists who believe in global warming that are are doing research in good faith bute there is a major problem. The science has become so politicized that there is very little room for debate. Personally I have never witnessed a debate by believers and skeptics and would pay to watch that. Unfortunately the global warming cult would never allow this to happen. &quot;Science guy&quot; Bill Nye even thinks climate skeptics (referred to as &quot;deniers&quot; to associate them with Holocaust deniers) should be locked up! We just had the coldest wettest winter on record with almost NO MEDIA COVERAGE! At the very least people should be concerned about the many scandals perpetrated by the climate change alarmists which include revising observed historical temperature observations downward, ignoring problems with temperature stations (90% don&#39;t meet criteria for proper placement) and giving zero credence to other potential causes of climate change - most notably solar activity. Climate alarmist cannot explain the Medieval warm period when the CO2 levels were much lower or the recent &quot;pause&quot; when CO2 went up 15% over the course of just a couple decades. The planet is a much more complex system than can be fully understood and the only way we could show a thorough understanding is by making models that accurately predict future temperatures. Almost ALL of the models that come from climate alarmists over-predict warming, many of them wildly so. When it starts getting cold for a decade or two can we stop all of this nonsense?   \n",

Keep in mind that climate change involves many disciplines and very few people are masters of all. Climate involves physics, astronomy, geology, climatology, ocean study and other physical sciences.

Yet. But we will eventually. You don't know everything, why should I take your opinion seriously? You say someone robbed your house and I say the dogs did it.

We really need to start investing money in the technology which may alleviate the drastic environmental changes that are soon to come.   \n",

They said the only cure for GW is ... a lot less people. Getting rid of fossil fuels is the best and fastest way to reach that goal. Without fossil fuels we can only feed around one billion out of the seven billion people living on this planet. Remember that those calling for the end of fossil fuels are advocating for the deaths of the vast majority of human race.   \n",

U actually took it without even knowing. U thought u were taking \"sedatives\". It's fucking opiates u get at the hospital bro. They give u drugs that are an atom away from heroin during surgery.   \n",

Only ice that is on land and not displacing it’s mass by floating in the oceans can contribute to sea levels rising.   \n",

Because he said Y about z and because Y is false Z is therefore false as well. Y is the subject of Z not an equivalent. this is kindergarten math I can’t believe I have to explain this. Your statement is utterly useless and has nothing to do with the argument of pollution. That would be like me saying conservatives are wrong about pro-life because one conservative said one wrong thing about fetuses....   \n",

While I'm a conservative, I see that this climate change debacle is a tug of political/ideological war amongst both sides of the political spectrum. I also see that conservatives tend to not read and study the evidence for this proposed climate crisis in fear of agreeing with the ideological tactics the left tend to use in explaining and attempting to solve the environmental problem, even if some of their data may be valid. While that is fair, we shouldn't immediately disagree with the proposed data by using our political lenses as a convenience. The parent commenter said that we should support Trump the disengagement with China in order to mitigate the proposed climate crisis, which is often a tactic the left use as well in persuading people to agree with their side. The, \"if we are concerned about X then we should support Y because Y does Z\" is nothing more than political garble from both sides. One should be careful in these types of sayings.   \n",

First of all because I’m 90% sure that when you talk about data , you don’t talk about actual data , you’re referring to latest shitty article you read in some newspaper written by some nobody who just regurgitated what he read from a blogger who himself just retold what he read on another blog from someone who read data , misunderstood it , oversimplified it and then spread some misinformation , like with that whole « 4% man-made carbon » because some fucking retard cannot tell the difference between total carbon and carbon flux . You rely on people digesting the information before throwing it up in your face and then since you carefully pick the most retarded and dishonnest ones like Al Gore or AOC it just makes for a fine excuse to point at the dunces and their hyperboles and misinterpretation of data and attribute the blame to the data which you didn’t even consult yourself .   \n",

Manufacturing produces far more emissions than the individual actions of people. The US and China actually export a similar number of goods. Of course the US can and will do better as technology Improves, but China also has to reign in the pollution caused by their manufacturer in processes. I actually don't think that the left and right are as far apart on this issue as it may appear. Liberals want to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels, which is a good goal. Conservatives want to increase the amount of power we receive from nuclear power plants, which is also a good goal. I feel like there is a certain amount of compromise that can be reached there   \n",

There are predictions about temperature change. Like do you mean short term, or long term predictions? there are many accurate long-term predictions and forecasts about temperature and climate. If you are referring to short-term, one-day temperature predictions, then no, we cannot predict that. But thats the WEATHER, not the overall CLIMATE. I think you may be confusing the two. Another thing you mentioned was \"effective course of action\". There IS an effective course of action; reduce CO2 and greenhouse gas emissions. That would help preserve the stability of our climates. This is the course of action that would stop man's influence on climate change, but it would have terrible effects on the economy and progress. For this reason I agree with you 100% that innovation and technology is our best bet. And no. Im not saying that there was more man made climate change back then. What im saying is that climate change ALSO existed back then. Ever since the Industrial revolution, the climate has been increasingly volatile and unpredictable. But now, instead of a heatwave once every 10, or 15 years; there is a heatwave every 2 - 3 years. Heres another question for you. How do you explain all of the floodings and cat 5 hurricanes that have been happening? It seems like every couple years we have a \"Once in 100 year\" flood. To say that humans havent had an influence on this is ignorant. We cannot say forsure that climate change is due solely to human intervention, but there is a positive correlation between emissions and the increase in average global temperature. Finally, very few politicians are calling for those prescriptions. The ones that are suggesting these things, or \"Green New Deals\", are just imbeciles. But we should without a doubt consider some of these things - in a non-extreme proportion.   \n",

That’s why they changed it from global warming to climate change because yes the climate does change funnily enough and at the moment Antarctica is seeing some of the largest ice buildups in the past few decades but they don’t tell you that in the mainstream media, they say flooding and erosion are destroying coastal cites and islands, and that naturally occurring forest fires in Siberia are causing heating in the North Pole, but it’s the middle of summer. But when it’s Christmas there will be snow storms and hurricanes in the northern hemisphere. Humans just forget that we are not meant to stay in one place for too long and we have to move with the earth and sea.   \n",

What that has to do with socialism and \"globalism\" I might never\\nknow. Also, our models have been accurate, they've successfully reproduced\\ntemperatures since 1900 globally, on land, in the air, and in the ocean. But\\nthe hyperbole and extreme rhetoric has been unwavering, which is a distraction\\nfrom the actual dangers of global warming (which has nothing to do with\\nFlorida being underwater in three years, whoever made that up).\\n\\n   \n",

       "181  There is a problem with the doctor/cancer analogy that was used. He mentions\\nthat the doctors would have no reason to lie to him. This is not the case,\\nhowever, with Climate scientists. There funding i.e. income, is predicated on\\nthe notion that scientists agree that climate change is happening, that it is\\ncatastrophic and that it is human-caused. Note that the foremost hurricane\\nforecaster, Bill Gray, received government funding for his research from 1960\\nto 1993. It was cut off by the Clinton Admistration since it went against the\\nnarrative of global warming and the catastrophic predictions of internet\\ninventor Al Gore. There are plenty of scientists that disagree with man-made\\nglobal warming including Nobel laureates. There are also scientists who\\nbelieve in global warming that are are doing research in good faith bute there\\nis a major problem. The science has become so politicized that there is very\\nlittle room for debate. Personally I have never witnessed a debate by\\nbelievers and skeptics and would pay to watch that. Unfortunately the global\\nwarming cult would never allow this to happen. \"Science guy\" Bill Nye even\\nthinks climate skeptics (referred to as \"deniers\" to associate them with\\nHolocaust deniers) should be locked up! We just had the coldest wettest winter\\non record with almost NO MEDIA COVERAGE! At the very least people should be\\nconcerned about the many scandals perpetrated by the climate change alarmists\\nwhich include revising observed historical temperature observations downward,\\nignoring problems with temperature stations (90% don't meet criteria for\\nproper placement) and giving zero credence to other potential causes of\\nclimate change - most notably solar activity. Climate alarmist cannot explain\\nthe Medieval warm period when the CO2 levels were much lower or the recent\\n\"pause\" when CO2 went up 15% over the course of just a couple decades. The\\nplanet is a much more complex system than can be fully understood and the only\\nway we could show a thorough understanding is by making models that accurately\\npredict future temperatures. Almost ALL of the models that come from climate\\nalarmists over-predict warming, many of them wildly so.

They said\\nthe only cure for GW is ... a lot less people. Getting rid of fossil fuels is\\nthe best and fastest way to reach that goal.

Because he said Y about z and because Y is false Z is therefore false\\nas well. Y is the subject of Z not an equivalent. this is kindergarten math I\\ncan’t believe I have to explain this. Your statement is utterly useless and\\nhas nothing to do with the argument of pollution.

While I'm a conservative, I see that this\\nclimate change debacle is a tug of political/ideological war amongst both\\nsides of the political spectrum. I also see that conservatives tend to not\\nread and study the evidence for this proposed climate crisis in fear of\\nagreeing with the ideological tactics the left tend to use in explaining and\\nattempting to solve the environmental problem, even if some of their data may\\nbe valid. While that is fair, we shouldn't immediately disagree with the\\nproposed data by using our political lenses as a convenience. The parent\\ncommenter said that we should support Trump the disengagement with China in\\norder to mitigate the proposed climate crisis, which is often a tactic the\\nleft use as well in persuading people to agree with their side. The, \"if we\\nare concerned about X then we should support Y because Y does Z\" is nothing\\nmore than political garble from both sides.

First\\nof all because I’m 90% sure that when you talk about data , you don’t talk\\nabout actual data , you’re referring to latest shitty article you read in some\\nnewspaper written by some nobody who just regurgitated what he read from a\\nblogger who himself just retold what he read on another blog from someone who\\nread data , misunderstood it , oversimplified it and then spread some\\nmisinformation , like with that whole « 4% man-made carbon » because some\\nfucking retard cannot tell the difference between total carbon and carbon flux\\n. You rely on people digesting the information before throwing it up in your\\nface and then since you carefully pick the most retarded and dishonnest ones\\nlike Al Gore or AOC it just makes for a fine excuse to point at the dunces and\\ntheir hyperboles and misinterpretation of data and attribute the blame to the\\ndata which you didn’t even consult yourself .\\n\\n   \n",

Manufacturing produces far more emissions than the individual actions\\nof people. The US and China actually export a similar number of goods. Of\\ncourse the US can and will do better as technology Improves, but China also\\nhas to reign in the pollution caused by their manufacturer in processes. I\\nactually don't think that the left and right are as far apart on this issue as\\nit may appear. Liberals want to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels, which is\\na good goal. Conservatives want to increase the amount of power we receive\\nfrom nuclear power plants, which is also a good goal. I feel like there is a\\ncertain amount of compromise that can be reached there\\n\\n   \n",

There are\\npredictions about temperature change. Like do you mean short term, or long\\nterm predictions? there are many accurate long-term predictions and forecasts\\nabout temperature and climate. If you are referring to short-term, one-day\\ntemperature predictions, then no, we cannot predict that. But thats the\\nWEATHER, not the overall CLIMATE. I think you may be confusing the two.\\nAnother thing you mentioned was \"effective course of action\". There IS an\\neffective course of action; reduce CO2 and greenhouse gas emissions. That\\nwould help preserve the stability of our climates. This is the course of\\naction that would stop man's influence on climate change, but it would have\\nterrible effects on the economy and progress. For this reason I agree with you\\n100% that innovation and technology is our best bet. And no. Im not saying\\nthat there was more man made climate change back then. What im saying is that\\nclimate change ALSO existed back then. Ever since the Industrial revolution,\\nthe climate has been increasingly volatile and unpredictable. But now, instead\\nof a heatwave once every 10, or 15 years; there is a heatwave every 2 - 3\\nyears. Heres another question for you. How do you explain all of the floodings\\nand cat 5 hurricanes that have been happening? It seems like every couple\\nyears we have a \"Once in 100 year\" flood. To say that humans havent had an\\ninfluence on this is ignorant. We cannot say forsure that climate change is\\ndue solely to human intervention, but there is a positive correlation between\\nemissions and the increase in average global temperature. Finally, very few\\npoliticians are calling for those prescriptions. The ones that are suggesting\\nthese things, or \"Green New Deals\", are just imbeciles. But we should without\\na doubt consider some of these things - in a non-extreme proportion.\\n\\n   \n",

That’s why they changed it from global warming to\\nclimate change because yes the climate does change funnily enough and at the\\nmoment Antarctica is seeing some of the largest ice buildups in the past few\\ndecades but they don’t tell you that in the mainstream media, they say\\nflooding and erosion are destroying coastal cites and islands, and that\\nnaturally occurring forest fires in Siberia are causing heating in the North\\nPole, but it’s the middle of summer. But when it’s Christmas there will be\\nsnow storms and hurricanes in the northern hemisphere. Humans just forget that\\nwe are not meant to stay in one place for too long and we have to move with\\nthe earth and sea.\\n\\n   \n",

       "94   @LiveWell6 yeah but now they are just expanding their trade with other countries and the USA is doing the opposite which gives use less influence in those areas as time goes on. So in the short term it hurts China but in the long term it helps them and increase their investment in other countries which gets them allies down the road. When we don't have those countries as our allies it's harder for use to get things we want from these same countries and weakens our global status.   \n",

That would help preserve the stability of our climates. This is the course of action that would stop man's influence on climate change, but it would have terrible effects on the economy and progress. For this reason I agree with you 100% that innovation and technology is our best bet. And no. Im not saying that there was more man made climate change back then. What im saying is that climate change ALSO existed back then. Ever since the Industrial revolution, the climate has been increasingly volatile and unpredictable. But now, instead of a heatwave once every 10, or 15 years; there is a heatwave every 2 - 3 years. Heres another question for you. How do you explain all of the floodings and cat 5 hurricanes that have been happening? It seems like every couple years we have a \"Once in 100 year\" flood. To say that humans havent had an influence on this is ignorant. We cannot say forsure that climate change is due solely to human intervention, but there is a positive correlation between emissions and the increase in average global temperature. Finally, very few politicians are calling for those prescriptions. The ones that are suggesting these things, or \"Green New Deals\", are just imbeciles.

       "74   @dkosmari Im not sure what you mean by \"predicting temperatures\". There are predictions about temperature change. Like do you mean short term, or long term predictions? there are many accurate long-term predictions and forecasts about temperature and climate. If you are referring to short-term, one-day temperature predictions, then no, we cannot predict that. But thats the WEATHER, not the overall CLIMATE. I think you may be confusing the two. Another thing you mentioned was \"effective course of action\". There IS an effective course of action; reduce CO2 and greenhouse gas emissions. That would help preserve the stability of our climates. This is the course of action that would stop man's influence on climate change, but it would have terrible effects on the economy and progress. For this reason I agree with you 100% that innovation and technology is our best bet. And no. Im not saying that there was more man made climate change back then. What im saying is that climate change ALSO existed back then. Ever since the Industrial revolution, the climate has been increasingly volatile and unpredictable. But now, instead of a heatwave once every 10, or 15 years; there is a heatwave every 2 - 3 years. Heres another question for you. How do you explain all of the floodings and cat 5 hurricanes that have been happening? It seems like every couple years we have a \"Once in 100 year\" flood. To say that humans havent had an influence on this is ignorant. We cannot say forsure that climate change is due solely to human intervention, but there is a positive correlation between emissions and the increase in average global temperature. Finally, very few politicians are calling for those prescriptions. The ones that are suggesting these things, or \"Green New Deals\", are just imbeciles. But we should without a doubt consider some of these things - in a non-extreme proportion.   \n",

Dry places like deserts don't receive rain much because the air currents either flow around them or through a mountain range where all the moisture is dropped before reaching the desert. Some places aren't quite deserts but they are still pretty dry. If a warmer climate shifts the flow of rain a little bit it could get more precipitation or less. Where I live we are 10 inches above normal rain fall for this year. Last year we was 8 inches above normal rain fall. What's your answer for why it keeps getting hotter and I keep getting above average rain fall. I assume your question for what does win against climate look like, was ment to be gotcha but unfortunately for you we actually have an answer. Return the co2 parts per million back to the levels they were at before the first industry revolution.   \n",

But you say it is a “HUGE problem”. But you didn’t describe a problem. You simply stated observations. As a result of that, what exactly is the problem? There’s no denying climate is changing (as it always has) but there’s no 100% consensus on the degree of man-made climate change. Many of you seem to be in an absolute panic over warner weather - cold kills more though - so again, what is the problem? And if there is indeed a problem, what can be done about it? Because the correlation between GAT and CO2 levels is weak, will eliminating fossil fuels even cool the planet (at the risk of killing millions/billions anyway)?   \n",

What happened to the global freeze? Why isn’t NYC under water yet? Why isn’t the US a desert? Which one of Al Gores predictions has come true and how many haven’t? We get given their data and their predictions every single week. Their data backs up what they are claiming but at no point do their alarmist predictions ever materialise, which puts the validity of their data in to question. I am happy to fight the cause but when the alarmists are continuously wrong, the solutions are always more tax and redistribution of wealth and less eating of meat, I can’t get on board.

The predictions have failed, which means scientists still don't know. But politicians are capitalizing on it, saying \"and that's why I should take more of your money.\" Also, here's a concrete example of malicious extrapolation to create fake science: France went through a heat wave, everyone was crying out how they were the highest temperatures in record, since 1947. Except, if you look it up, you'll actually find this: https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/115683578 a newspaper article from 1930 reporting an even higher temperature. Was there more man-made climate change back then than there are now? Everyone defending climate change policies uses double standards, \"the 1930 heat wave was weather, the 2019 heat wave was climate\". Or we could go back only a few weeks, when NASA reported that the \"fastest shrinking glacier in the world\" is actually growing; instead of admitting they don't know what the hell is going on, most scientists just went looking for another glacier to be their \"proof that the sky is falling.\" That doesn't mean I want pollution to continue. I like the environment because I live in it. I'd rather invest in more technology, more efficient ways to use energy, more nuclear power, than to accept silly prescriptions such as pay more taxes, kill all cows, cover perfectly productive farm land with solar panels, forcefully reduce the number of people on the planet, undo the industrial revolution, etc.   \n",

You can't have it both ways. That's the problem with the whole climate ruse. It's a rigged game of heads I win, tails you lose. More rain = climate change Drought = climate change Very cold = climate change Very warm = climate change Bad storms = climate change Extremely mild = climate change Flooding = climate change Receding water levels = climate change I want to hear how we know if we have solved the \"climate crisis\". They compare it to WW2 . Well with WW 2 we knew we won when we defeated the Nazis and the Japanese. With climate change how do we know we won?   \n",

Now we basically have blazing heat in summer and then it goes somehow into muddy territorry and a little bit of snow in Winter. But we don&#39;t even really have the spring we used to have anymore. Or the autumn. Where I live we don&#39;t even get snow anymore, and each year the temperatures in summer are higher and higher. This year we even had over 40 Celcius. Never had that before.   \n",

It's not hard to research climate change, theres been tons of peer-reviewed studies on a multitude of factors. While many climate alarmist greatly overstated the effects and the timeframe of Climate Change, the trends they were predicting were right, and the vast majority of people who used to shrug climate change off eventually conceded to its existence by the sheer fact that there really isn't an ounce of evidence or a solid argument to be made advocating against Climate Change   \n",

We should reduce our contribution for sure, but not at the expense of our own lives and wellbeing.<br /><br />What we should be preparing for is the inevitable change in climate that would happen with or without humans on the planet, geological history shows the earth going through intense warm and cold cycles.

Before the industrial revolution, there were a certain number of trees. And as trees need CO2 to live on we can assume that at that time we were producing enough CO2 to keep all of them alive. Now during and after the Industrial Revolution, we started to cut trees by the millions while adding more CO2 to the environment. Now there is more CO2 in the Atmosphere than the trees that can process them. I think you can draw the obvious conclusion. And yes, I am aware that we are overdue for an Ice age. Not any other kind of weather change. And last time I checked, our planet was getting hotter. So please don't twist it like our planet is overdue for a major climate change so we might as well go in it Guns blazing and hot. Better safe than sorry.   \n",

       "74   @ Im not sure what you mean by \"predicting temperatures\". There are\\npredictions about temperature change. Like do you mean short term, or long\\nterm predictions? there are many accurate long-term predictions and forecasts\\nabout temperature and climate. If you are referring to short-term, one-day\\ntemperature predictions, then no, we cannot predict that. But thats the\\nWEATHER, not the overall CLIMATE. I think you may be confusing the two.\\nAnother thing you mentioned was \"effective course of action\". There IS an\\neffective course of action; reduce CO2 and greenhouse gas emissions. That\\nwould help preserve the stability of our climates. This is the course of\\naction that would stop man's influence on climate change, but it would have\\nterrible effects on the economy and progress. For this reason I agree with you\\n100% that innovation and technology is our best bet. And no. Im not saying\\nthat there was more man made climate change back then. What im saying is that\\nclimate change ALSO existed back then. Ever since the Industrial revolution,\\nthe climate has been increasingly volatile and unpredictable. But now, instead\\nof a heatwave once every 10, or 15 years; there is a heatwave every 2 - 3\\nyears. Heres another question for you. How do you explain all of the floodings\\nand cat 5 hurricanes that have been happening? It seems like every couple\\nyears we have a \"Once in 100 year\" flood. To say that humans havent had an\\ninfluence on this is ignorant. We cannot say forsure that climate change is\\ndue solely to human intervention, but there is a positive correlation between\\nemissions and the increase in average global temperature. Finally, very few\\npoliticians are calling for those prescriptions. The ones that are suggesting\\nthese things, or \"Green New Deals\", are just imbeciles.

Before the industrial\\nrevolution, there were a certain number of trees. And as trees need CO2 to\\nlive on we can assume that at that time we were producing enough CO2 to keep\\nall of them alive. Now during and after the Industrial Revolution, we started\\nto cut trees by the millions while adding more CO2 to the environment. Now\\nthere is more CO2 in the Atmosphere than the trees that can process them. I\\nthink you can draw the obvious conclusion. And yes, I am aware that we are\\noverdue for an Ice age. Not any other kind of weather change. And last time I\\nchecked, our planet was getting hotter. So please don't twist it like our\\nplanet is overdue for a major climate change so we might as well go in it Guns\\nblazing and hot. Better safe than sorry.\\n\\n   \n",
